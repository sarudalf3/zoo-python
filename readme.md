# Python Zoo

This assignment has the target to practice hierarchies and class in Python.
The targets are:

- Use hierachies
- Association between classes
- Methods
- Polymorphism

This is a game when I created a zoo and you should feed and breed different animals. There are 4 different kind of animals: Bear, Penguin, Octopus and Giraffe.

Each animal has a name, age, healthy and hapiness level. 
There is an interactive method when you can print the whole animals on zoo, feed and create new animals.
